Archmind is a geometric kernel that provides basic topological operators on non-manifold meshes.
The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use tool for fast prototyping mesh algorithms in python and c++.

Main features:
  * Representation of arbitrary non-manifold polygonal meshes
  * Geometric operators (split,join,triangulate)
  * Fast access to entity neighboring information
  * Python interface
  * Data and attributes can be attached to the entities through compile time polymorphism in c++ and dynamically in python

The Library is free for commercial use and open source under the Zlib Licence.
